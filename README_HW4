HW 4

Flags usage:
	//to start the file system use tthe following flags
	//it must have an argument of one of each type
	-fs <real|stub> <cscan|fifo>
	
	//this is optional for testing creating files
	-C <file name> size
	
Test conditions have been added under FileSystemTest
these require the following flag
	the flag to enable this file is -HW4T
	it contains an inner class with runnables that call copy several type
	at different occasions to test accessing readSector and Write sector from
	different areas.
	

example of running parameters: -d Ff  -f -fs real fifo -ncpu 5  -HW4T
this will format the drive and create 7 files using fifo and the real file nachos system
this can be manipulated with the above testing flags to create different outputs
-d Ff  -fs real fifo -ncpu 5  -x testone
this example test that the shell was put out after running the above flags


Implementation of DiskDriver contains a queue that keeps all the tasks, the interrupt
calls a semaphore which frees the current waiting WorkTask and gets the next one and immediaty
dispaches if no other thread has called the current disk to perform a task
