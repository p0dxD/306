Added Components HW3
1. First-come, first-served (FCFS, non-preemptive): For this mode the 
	default implemantation was left, it utilizes two FIFOQueues one for user threads
	and one for the kernel threads.
FLAG: no flag 

2. Round-robin (RR, preemptive): For this two queues are used one for the UserThreads
	and one for the Kernel threads, both are FIFOQueues. The scheduler chooses from 
	user queue if kernel queue is empty. The max quantum for initial RR is 100 with a 
	max of 1000 at which point it yields to a kernel thread as priority, or a user thread
	if there is no kernel thread. 
FLAG: -rr

3. Shortest process next (SPN, non-preemptive): This uses two queues one FIFO for kernel threads,
	one PriorityQueue which takes in a SPNComparator which sorts the processes based on burst.
	Once a process calls the PredicCPU system call the cpu is yield to reposition it back in the 
	queue at the correct location, only the user threads happen to go through this. The program
	then runs till the end once it has been positioned to the correct location without further 
	interruptions.
FLAG: -spn

4. Shortest remaining time first (SRT, preemptive upon process arrival): It uses the same queues as
	the SPN but in this case we preempt when a process arrives , we run this one or we run a kernel
	if there is a kernel thread waiting on the FIFO queue. 

FLAG: -srt

5. Highest response-ratio next (HRRN, non-preemptive): 

FLAG: -hrrn

6. Feedback scheduling (preemptive, use 5 queues):

FLAG: -fbs
