Testing:
Execute Test via ExecTest.java when nachos starts up. It creates ProgTest threads that run the respective C programs. 


Overview:

I.AddrSpace.java
We implemented mapping for the program from virtual pages to physical pages. 
To do so, we created a static boolean vector to keep track of the physical pages that were free in the system.
 Therefore, when there is a request for physical page memory, we check the boolean vector to see if the space is already occupied. 
 If it is not, we take the index of the free physical page, and map it to the virtual page of the process. 


II.Syscall.java
a)Exec():
For Exec, we used call the exec() function in the address space, which initializes the page Tables for the address space. 
Instead of the original one-to-one mapping in single programming, we keep track of used/free physical pages in Main Memory.
Then we return the free physical pages, and maps it to the virtual pages for multiprogramming.  

b) Fork(): 
For forking, we created a new UserThread every time fork() is called. 
The newly spawned thread is constructed by sharing the address space with the currently running NachosThread. 
It takes the user address of the function to execute, and loads it into the MIPS PC register. 
It also calculates the address of the stack pointer for the newly spawned thread. 

c) Yield():
Links the system call to the scheduler's yield() function. 

d) Join():
AddrSpaces are stored in hashMap, which the exit status of the child process as values. 
When the child process returns, will V() on the semaphore and modify the exit status 
for the ProcessInformation object. This will wake up the parent thread if it is blocking. 
Then, the parent thread will check the hashMap and grab the ProcessInformation to check the exit status of the child. 


III.UserThread.java
Has variable for the console that the thread uses. 

IV.ConsoleManager
contains a boolean array to keep track of used consoles. Instantiates consoles and returns them for fulfilling requests.
